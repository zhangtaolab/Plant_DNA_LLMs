For developers who want to use our inference code in the Jupyter Notebook or other places, we developed a simple API package in the `pdllib`, which allows users directly call the inference function.

Besides, we provide a Demo that shows the usage of our API, see [notebook/inference_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/zhangtaolab/Plant_DNA_LLMs/blob/main/notebook/inference_demo.ipynb).
