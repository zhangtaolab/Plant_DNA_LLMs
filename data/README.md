We provide a sample dataset includes sequence with (1) or without (0) H3K27ac histone modification for fine-tune and inference.

Pre-train dataset and plant genomic datasets for fine-tuning are available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/zhangtaolab/) and [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/zhangtaolab) datasets.

Detailed information about how to generate fine-tune data can be found in the supplementary information of our manuscript.
